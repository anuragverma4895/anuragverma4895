# 👋 Hi, I'm **Anurag Verma**

I’m a **B.Tech CSE (AI) student** passionate about building **intelligent systems** that solve real-world problems.  

With a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, I actively practice problem-solving on platforms like **LeetCode** and **CodeChef**. Alongside DSA, I’ve studied **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** as part of my coursework and implemented small projects to explore their applications.
