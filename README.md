# 👋 Hi, I'm **Anurag Verma**

I’m a **B.Tech CSE (AI) student** passionate about learning and exploring new technologies that solve real-world problems.  

I have a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and actively practice problem-solving on platforms like **LeetCode**, **CodeChef**, and **Codeforces**. Alongside DSA, I’ve studied **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** as part of my coursework and implemented small projects to explore their applications.
