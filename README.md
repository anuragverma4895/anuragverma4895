👋 Hi, I'm Anurag Verma

I’m a B.Tech CSE (AI) student passionate about solving problems and building intelligent systems.

I have a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and actively practice problem-solving on LeetCode and CodeChef.
Alongside DSA, I’ve studied Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) as part of my coursework and have implemented small projects to understand their applications. While I’m still exploring these domains, they have sparked my interest in creating smart and efficient solutions.

🧠 Skills & Tools

Languages: C++, Python, JavaScript(learning)

Core CS: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Explored Subjects: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Web Development: MERN Stack

🚀 What I’m Doing

Practicing DSA for coding contests and interview preparation

Learning MERN stack for building full-stack web applications

Exploring AI/ML/DL concepts and working on small implementations to build practical knowledge

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m always open to collaborations and knowledge exchange.
Feel free to reach out!
